# C-standard-library-functions

Purpose/requirements:
- Gain a basic understanding of general C programming
- Create a library that can be used later on at 42, because using functions we did not make is considered cheating
- Intro to Makefiles and compiling using the gcc compiler

What I learned:
- Basics of creating C functions, using pointers, and creating/manipulating data structures
- That standard C functions are actually pretty straight forward. If I need a function to do something SLIGHTLY
different it can be done easily! ie. making char *str_join(char *s1, char *s2) free either one or both of the strings
passed as parameters! Super useful!

Overall this was a pretty good project. While it was tedious and time consuming it was a very strong introduction to the
C programming language. Even still my libft function library is evolving as I add new functions and improve on previous
functions.
